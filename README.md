# Facility Energy Saving and Securing Technology (FEST)
FEST project focuses on developing algorithmic tools and techniques for analyzing cyber-physical security, 
and optimal scheduling, operation and planning of Distributed Energy Resources (DER). 
## Building Energy Optimization
The Energy Optimization Tool is part of the FEST project. 
It leverages techniques from modeling, machine learning, and predictive strategies to optimize the scheduling of distributed resources, thereby reducing building energy usage and increasing the comfort level of critical loads.

### GUI of the Energy Optimization Tool
```
python GUI_design.py
```
A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is designed for a software demonstration. The tool aims to minimize the operating cost, asks the user to select a machine learning algorithm from a set of three baseline algorithms, and demonstrates three system configurations (w/ PV only, w/ battery storage only, w/ PV and battery storage). Users can follow the note displayed in the GUI to configure test cases.
